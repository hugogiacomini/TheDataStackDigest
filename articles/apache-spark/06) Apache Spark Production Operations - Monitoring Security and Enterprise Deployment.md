### Concept and Mental Model

Think of Spark monitoring like managing a busy restaurant kitchen. You need real-time visibility into every station (executors), ingredient quality (data), cooking times (job performance), and customer satisfaction (SLAs). Without proper instrumentation, you're cooking blind.

### Why It Matters in Real Pipelines

Production Spark jobs process terabytes daily with strict SLAs. A single poorly performing job can cascade failures across downstream systems, causing business impact measured in millions. Comprehensive monitoring enables:

- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Catch problems before they impact SLAs
- **Cost Visibility**: Track resource consumption and optimize spend
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Ensure data integrity across transformation pipelines
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and tune for efficiency
