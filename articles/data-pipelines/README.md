# Data Pipeline Design

This section covers the design, implementation, and optimization of data pipelines for various use cases.

## 🔄 Pipeline Patterns

### ETL vs ELT
- Traditional ETL approaches
- Modern ELT patterns
- When to use each approach
- Hybrid strategies

### Processing Types
- Batch processing patterns
